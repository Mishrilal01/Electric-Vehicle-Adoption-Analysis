# Electric-Vehicle-Adoption-Analysis
📄 Description:
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) registration data from Washington State to explore adoption trends. Using Excel, we cleaned and transformed the dataset (~95,000 rows), created PivotTables, and built an interactive dashboard with slicers and KPIs. The goal was to uncover insights on EV distribution, popular brands, and eligibility for clean fuel programs.

🔧 Data Preprocessing:
Removed null/missing data and zero-range vehicles

Added helper columns like VIN count

Used Excel Table format for dynamic PivotTable support

Implemented slicers (filters) for County, Make, Year, Vehicle Type

📈 Analysis & Dashboard:
Visuals Used:

EV Count by County – Bar Chart

EV Count by Make – Column Chart

EV Type Distribution – Donut Chart

Yearly Trend – Line Chart

CAFV Eligibility by Type – Stacked Column

Average Range by Make – Bar Chart

EV Count by City – Column Chart

KPI Cards:

Total Electric Vehicles

Average Electric Range

Unique Cities

Unique Manufacturers

🔍 Key Insights:
King County has the highest EV registrations

Tesla and Nissan are the most popular EV brands

BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) dominate

Most EVs are CAFV eligible

Average range exceeds 200 miles

📅 Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates how Excel can be used for effective data analysis and visualization. The dashboard enables dynamic exploration of trends in electric mobility and showcases the potential of clean transportation solutions.
